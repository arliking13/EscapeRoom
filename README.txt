Welcome to Our Escape Room Game!

To start the game, run the Main.java class located in the default package within the src folder.

Game Overview:
Upon launching, a start screen will appear, offering two options: "Play" or "Exit." Selecting "Exit" will terminate the Java application, while choosing "Play" will launch you into the game.

Controls:
- Use the WASD keys for movement.
- Press the Space key to fly upward and the Shift key to descend.

Game Features:
Our escape room contains two main puzzles and one Easter egg feature involving morphing. You may tackle the puzzles in any order.

Puzzle 1: The Crosses
- Objective: Align all the crosses hanging on the wall by rotating them. Click on each cross to adjust its position.
- Completion: When solved correctly, a bell sound will indicate success.

Puzzle 2: The 2D Maze
- Location: Positioned on the wall opposite the crosses.
- Activation: Double-click the puzzle while facing it to begin. Note: Your position will lock upon entering. To exit the maze and resume free movement, double-click again.
- Controls: Use the arrow keys to navigate the 2D maze, avoid ghosts, collect the key, and reach the door.
- Completion: A bell sound will play upon successfully finishing the maze.

The Escape Door:
- Location: Next to the 2D maze puzzle.
- Unlocking: The door remains locked until both puzzles are completed. Attempting to open it prematurely triggers a locked door sound effect.
- Success: After solving both puzzles, click the escape door to reveal the win screen, accompanied by cheerful sound effects celebrating your escape.

Easter Egg: The Morphing Lamp
- Feature: Click the lamp to transform it into a sphere. Click again to revert it to its original lamp form.
- Note: We enjoyed adding this morphing element as a fun surprise to meet our morphing objective.

We hope you enjoy our game! Thank you for playing!
